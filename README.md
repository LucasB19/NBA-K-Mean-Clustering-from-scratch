# NBA-K-Mean-Clustering-from-scratch
Implementing K-Mean clustering algorithm from scratch to analyze and group datasets, showcasing the process without relying on external libraries for core logic. This project emphasizes understanding and applying fundamental data clustering principles.

## Overview
This project features a from-scratch implementation of the K-Mean clustering algorithm, applied to datasets like NBA 3-Point Field Goal and Iris. It aims to illustrate the core principles of data clustering without external libraries for the algorithmic part, juxtaposed with Scikit-learn's implementation for comparison.

## Features
- K-Mean clustering algorithm developed from scratch.
- Data visualization and cluster analysis.
- Performance comparison with Scikit-learnâ€™s K-Mean implementation.
- Unit testing to ensure algorithm reliability and a
- Performance and efficiency evaluation.

## Installation
Ensure Python and the following packages are installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
## Usage
Execute the notebook via Jupyter
